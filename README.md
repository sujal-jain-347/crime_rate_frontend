The frontend of the crime rate prediction ,
which is used for the client side scripting web app,
it can be employ with the its backend in the repository 
i.e  crime rate prediction project

Crime is one of the biggest and dominating problem in our
society. Daily there are huge number of crimes committed
frequently. In our project we use the dataset of the past
committed crime as an input and predict the rate of crime in
the future by the use of the machine learning concepts which
will helps the government for making policy for the
prevention of crime and public by making them aware of the
crime happenings surround them.

Here we have use the :
html 
Css,
JavaScript,
Browser API,

I hope that Crime rate prediction app will help the law
makers for making the effective criminal policy for
prevention of the crime, public by making them
aware of the crime happenings surround them,
significantly enhance the police patrolling by
making them more targeted and pro active,
can be used by the criminologists for research
and academics purpose. It will provide the
prediction crime rate, choropleth mapping of
crime, data visualization, predictive insights
